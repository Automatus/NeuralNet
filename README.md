# NeuralNet
Artificial Neural Network

v1:
- Neurons will only fire above treshold value (boolean output)
- bias for all neurons the same
- learnig algorithm = backpropagation without differentiation 
- programming language: Python 3.x

v2:
- making the code better/scaleable
- using numpy

v2.1:
- save and open neural networks

learning:
- to learn more about matrix multiplication and for a matrix calculator look at https://www.mathsisfun.com
- the free 40 page book from Andy Thomas could be useful: https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/coding-deep-learning-revolution-sale/
