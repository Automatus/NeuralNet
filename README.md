Artificial Neural Network
Use the MODULE file 
Neuralnetv2, v2 and v2.1 are old versions

v1:
- Neurons will only fire above treshold value (boolean output)
- bias for all neurons the same
- learnig algorithm = backpropagation without differentiation 
- programming language: Python 3.x

v2:
- making the code better/scaleable
- using numpy

v2.1:
- save and open neural networks

MODULE: AI module
