# NeuralNet
Artificial Neural Network

Current design:
- Neurons will only fire above treshold value (boolean output)
- bias for all neurons the same
- learnig algorithm = backpropagation without differentiation 
- programming language: Python 3.x

next steps:

- making the code better/scaleabe
- adding inhibitory neurons
- using numpy
