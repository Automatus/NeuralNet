# NeuralNet
Artificial Neural Network

- Neurons will only fire above treshold value (boolean output)
- learnig algorithm = backpropagation without differentiation, based on "neurons that fire together, wire together"
- using numpy
- create, save and open neural networks in terminal
- train with webcam
- the module can be used as standalone (terminal) application or as a library with functions to be used in other applications
