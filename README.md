# NeuralNet
Artificial Neural Network

- Neurons will only fire when > treshold value (boolean output, binary neurons)
- self made learnig algorithm based on the Hebbian Theory
- create, save and open neural networks in terminal
- train with webcam (works at least in recognizing trained data) or MNIST data (does not seem to work)
- the module can be used as a standalone (terminal) application or as a library with functions to be used in other applications




learning:
- to learn more about matrix multiplication and for a matrix calculator look at https://www.mathsisfun.com
- the free 40 page book from Andy Thomas could be useful: https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/coding-deep-learning-revolution-sale/
- on backpropagation (derivative): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ilg3gGewQ5U&t=163s
