# NeuralNet
Artificial Neural Network

v1:
- Neurons will only fire above treshold value (boolean output)
- bias for all neurons the same
- learnig algorithm = backpropagation without differentiation 
- programming language: Python 3.x

v2:
- making the code better/scaleable
- using numpy

v3:
- adding inhibitory neurons
